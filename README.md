### 👋 About Me

I am a **backend-focused engineer** who designs, builds, and operates **production AI systems**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Backend engineering
- Distributed systems
- LLM-powered applications (RAG)
- Cost- and latency-aware AI infrastructure

I focus less on models and more on **making AI reliable in real systems** — APIs, async pipelines, observability, and failure handling.

---

### 🧠 What I Build (Core Focus)

- Scalable **FastAPI** backends
- **RAG-based AI systems** with confidence scoring and fallbacks
- Async pipelines and background workers
- PostgreSQL & Redis–backed architectures
- Cost-optimized and latency-aware LLM integrations
- Production observability (logs, metrics, health checks)

I treat AI systems as **operational infrastructure**, not demos.

### 📌 Flagship Work

🔹 **Enterprise Knowledge Retrieval Backend (RAG)**  
A production-style backend that ingests documents, builds vector indexes, exposes secure APIs, tracks token cost and latency, and handles AI failure modes.

Key characteristics:
- Async ingestion pipelines
- Retrieval + re-ranking
- Confidence thresholds & fallbacks
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Structured logging and health checks

> This project exists to demonstrate **engineering judgment and ownership**, not features.

### 📓 Public Engineering Notebook

I maintain a **public engineering notebook** documenting real decisions and trade-offs while building AI systems:

- API design decisions
- LLM cost modeling
- RAG failure patterns
- Latency optimization
- Observability strategy
- What breaks at scale

This repository reflects how I think as an engineer in production environments.
